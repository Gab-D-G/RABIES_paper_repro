# Code and instructions to reproduce: Rodent Automated Bold Improvement of EPI Sequences (RABIES): A standardized image processing and data quality platform for rodent fMRI.
In this repository are found the scripts and associated instructions required to reproduce results reported in the manuscript. These consist of three main sections described below:
* RABIES_preprocessing/: conducting the preprocessing of 23 datasets using RABIES, and generation of associated quality control report for assessing registration performance (i.e. results in part 1 of the manuscript).
* RABIES_multicenter_diagnosis/: generating outputs from the confound correction and analysis stages of the pipeline, together with the quality control report for network analysis (the preprocessing in RABIES_preprocessing must be completed beforehand)
* analysis_figures/: reproducing figures associated to part 2 of the manuscript (using jupyter notebooks and pre-generated analysis outputs from RABIES)
